# ToDoList Example

## Setup
[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project from GitHub.

[Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the project from your repository.

> **Note**: After forking and cloning the repository, make sure you run the `npm install` command. This ensures that you have the `node_modules` folder in your project. This is the folder that has all the resources to run the project.

> **Note**: It is best practice NOT to check in folders that contain dependencies. This means you should NEVER check in the `node_modules` folder. It causes the repository to get large and is difficult to maintain.

## Exploration

2. Check out the `checked` HTML attribute found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_checked.asp).
3. Check out JavaScript objects found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp).
4. Learn how to make an [array](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) of JavaScript objects.
5. Learn about [Event Handling](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html) with React.

> **Note**: JavaScript objects are usually declared with the `var` keyword. We are using React so we use `const` or `let`.
